Introduction

This README provides an overview of binary trees and related concepts for your binary tree project. It covers the basics, key differences, time complexity considerations, common tree properties, traversal methods, and types of binary trees.

Binary Trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node in a binary tree has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that has the following property:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
Time Complexity

Compared to linked lists, binary trees offer significant time complexity improvements, especially for operations like searching, insertion, and deletion. While linked lists have O(n) time complexity for these operations, binary trees (BSTs) can achieve O(log n) time complexity on average, making them more efficient for certain tasks.

Tree Properties

Depth: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node.
Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth among all nodes.
Size: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.
Traversal Methods

Common traversal methods to navigate through a binary tree include:

Inorder Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
Preorder Traversal: Visits the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
Postorder Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
Level-order Traversal: Visits nodes level by level from left to right.
Types of Binary Trees

Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree where all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
Full Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differs by no more than one.
These concepts will serve as a solid foundation for your binary tree project. You can apply them to create, manipulate, and analyze binary trees effectively.
